# Exercise: Importing and Exporting Files in Node.js

## Task 1: Creating a Function

- Create a new file called `math.js`.
- In math.js, define a function called sum that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
- Export the sum function so that it can be used in another module.

## Task 2: Importing and Using the Function

- Create a new file called `index.js`.
- In index.js, import the sum function from the math.js module using require.
- Call the sum function with two numbers and log the result to the console.
- Task 3: Creating and Exporting an Object
- In math.js, define an object called calculator.
- Add a method to the calculator object called multiply that takes two arguments and returns their product.
- Export the calculator object so that it can be used in another module.

## Task 4: Importing and Using the Object

- In index.js, import the calculator object from the math.js module using require.

- Call the multiply method on the calculator object with two numbers and log the result to the console.

## Task 5: Creating and Exporting Multiple Functions

- In math.js, define a function called subtract that takes two arguments and returns their difference.
- Export the subtract function so that it can be used in another module.
- In index.js, import the subtract function from the math.js module using require.
  Call the subtract function with two numbers and log the result to the console

## Tips: Use module.exports to export functions and objects from a module

- Use require to import functions and objects from another module.
- You can export an object with multiple methods or properties by assigning the object to module.exports.
- Use module.exports = functionName to export a single function from a module.
