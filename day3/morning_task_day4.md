# Morning Exercise Day 4

## Create a new directory and navigate into it

## 1. Create a new file called main.js and write a program that does the following

- Accepts a command line argument that specifies the name of a file to read.

- Uses the Node.js file system module to read the contents of the file.

- Logs the contents of the file to the console.

- If the file does not exist, log an error message to the console.

- Create a new file called file.txt and add some content to it.

- Run the main.js program with the file.txt file name as a command line argument and verify that the contents of the file are logged to the console.

## 2. Modify the main.js program to do the following

- Accept two command line arguments: the name of a file to read and the name of a file to write to.

- Use the Node.js file system module to read the contents of the first file.

- Use the Node.js file system module to write the contents of the first file to the second file.

- If the first file does not exist, log an error message to the console.

- If the second file already exists, log an error message to the console.

- Run the modified main.js program with the file.txt file name as the first command line argument and a new file name as the second command line argument. Verify that the contents of file.txt are written to the new file.

- Create a new file called file2.txt and add some content to it.

- Modify the main.js program to do the following:

- Accept a command line argument that specifies a directory name.

- Use the Node.js file system module to read the contents of the directory.

- For each file in the directory, log the name of the file and its contents to the console.

- If the directory does not exist, log an error message to the console.

- Run the modified main.js program with the name of the directory that contains file.txt and file2.txt as a command line argument. Verify that the names and contents of both files are logged to the console.

## 3. Modify the main.js program to do the following

- Accept a command line argument that specifies a directory name.

- Use the Node.js file system module to read the contents of the directory.

- For each file in the directory, read its contents and store them in an array.

- Use the Node.js file system module to write the contents of the array to a new file called output.txt in the same directory.

- If the directory does not exist, log an error message to the console.

- Run the modified main.js program with the name of the directory that contains file.txt and file2.txt as a command line argument. Verify that a new file called output.txt is created in the same directory and contains the contents of both file.txt and file2.txt.
