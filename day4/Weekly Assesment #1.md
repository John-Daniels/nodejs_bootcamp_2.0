# Weekly Assessment #1

## Section 1: Theory `(20 marks)`

- What is Node.js and how does it differ from traditional server-side languages like PHP and Ruby? `(4 marks)`

- What are some of the advantages of using Node.js for backend development? `(4 marks)`

- How do you install Node.js on your machine? `(4 marks)`

- What is the Node.js module system and how does it work? `(4 marks)`

- What are npm modules and how do you install them in your project? `(4 marks)`

- Section 2: Practical `(80 marks)`

## Part A: Coding exercises `(60 marks)`

- Write a Node.js script that prints the current date and time to the console. `(10 marks)`

- Create a Node.js module that exports a function that accepts a string and returns the length of the string. Write a script that uses this module to calculate the length of a given string. `(10 marks)`

- Write a Node.js script that reads a text file and prints its contents to the console. `(10 marks)`

- Use the yargs module to create a command-line tool that allows users to add a new note. The tool should accept a title and body for the note and save it to a file. `(10 marks)`

- Use the yargs module to create a command-line tool that allows users to remove a note. The tool should accept a title and remove the note with that title from the file. `(10 marks)`

- Write a Node.js script that reads a CSV file and converts it to JSON format. `(10 marks)`

## Part B: Project (20 marks)

- Create a Node.js project that uses the yargs module to accept command-line arguments for a calculator tool. The tool should accept two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and perform the requested operation. `(10 marks)`

- Create a Node.js project that uses the fs module to read a directory and return a list of all files with a given extension (e.g. ".txt"). The project should accept the directory and extension as command-line arguments. `(10 marks)`

> Note: You may use any additional modules that you see fit for the above exercises.

Overall, this assessment covers the basics of Node.js, including installation, module system, npm modules, and command-line tools. It also tests your ability to write Node.js scripts and modules and to create projects using Node.js modules.
